# Documents & Entities

Queries return Documents. A Document provides a `.get` method to retrieve properties, and a `.set` to set them - as well as other utility methods depending on its type. All root documents are Object Entities, which also provide `.update`. Since Documents can contain arbitrary sub-objects, you can retrieve lists off them, which comes as List Entities and provide some common list methods too.

These methods are, of course, typed based on the shape of your schema definitions!

```ts
oneDoneItem.set('done', false);

anItemWithAnArrayField.get('arrayField').push('foo');
```

These will immediately update the in-memory document across all its subscribers (Entities are also cached by identity). The change will propagate to storage and sync asynchronously. When the change is stored, the document will update and drop the in-memory changes.
