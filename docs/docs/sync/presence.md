# Presence & Profiles

Once you're syncing, presence info is available on `client.sync.presence` (where `client` is your instance of Client).

You can get `presence.self`, `presence.peers`, or `presence.everyone`. You can also subscribe to change events: `peerChanged(userId, presence)`, `selfChanged(presence)`, `peersChanged(peers: { [userId]: presence })`. Note that if you did not supply user information on your server and used the example code above, all peers will show up with the same exact identity! If you want to make each peer individual, you need to give them all unique user IDs. You could generate them on your server in-memory if you don't want persistent profiles.

lo-fi distinguishes between "replica ID" (i.e. individual device) and "user ID." The intention is to allow one actual person to use multiple devices, but only have one presence which follows them between devices.

To update your presence, use `presence.update`.
